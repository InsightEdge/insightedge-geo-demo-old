# Real-time analytics on a streaming geospatial data: dynamic taxi pricing

## Overview

In this blog post we will create a demo application that runs real-time analytics on a streaming geospatial data.
We take a fundamental **supply and demand** economic model of price determination in a market.

>Demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers.
>The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship.
>Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain good producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price.
>The correlation between price and how much of a good or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship.
>Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.

To make it even more fun, we consider transportation business domain and taxi companies like Uber or Lyft in particularly.
In taxi services the order requests and available drivers represent the supply and demand data correspondingly.
It is interesting that this data is bound to geographical location which introduces additional complexity. Comparing to business areas like
retail, where the product demand is bound to either offline store or a well known list of warehouses, the order requests are geographically distributed.
With services like Uber the fare rates automatically increase, when the taxi demand is higher than drivers around you.
The Uber prices are [surging](https://help.uber.com/h/19572af0-d494-4885-a1ef-1a0d54d0e68f) to ensure reliability and availability for those who agree to pay a bit more.

You may identify the following architectural questions:
- how do we handle the various events like order request event or pickup event?
- how do we compute the price accounting the nearby requests? We need an efficient way to execute geospatial queries.
- how can we scale technology to run business in many cities, states or countries?
